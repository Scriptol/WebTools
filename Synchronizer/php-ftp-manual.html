<h2>What is PHP FTP Synchronizer?</h2>
<p>It is a software for transferring file on a Web site, working in
an automatic way, to update the contents of the site from file
created locally on a personal computer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It detects the modifications and
transfers modified files.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is possible in option to transfer
the files published since a certain number of days.</p>
<h2>Who addresses PHP FTP Synchronizer?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">To webmasters who realize a Web site
locally and then upload the pages on the server.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is not thus appropriate for those
which work directly on line on the site and in particular those whose
site is managed entirely by a CMS.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The software can nevertheless function
if one uses static pages along with content management systems such
as forums but it operates only on the static part.</p>
<h2>How the software works</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">One passes to the software the required
parameters: FTP address, login, password, remote directory, source
directory. The source directory is recursively scanned with its
sub-directories, contents are compared with remote contents, and
modified files are uploaded on the site.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The main options of acceleration are as
follows:</p>
<ul style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">One indicates a number of days
	spent, and all the files modified during these last days are
	transferred without comparison with the remote contents.</p>
  </li>
<li>One uses a local directory for
	backup. Instead of comparing the files with the remote site, which
	is very slow, one compares them with the contents of the backup what
	is instantaneous, and one updates at the same time the backup and
	the site.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How the program is used</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The program is used at command l line,
in DOS window or an Unix console.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is recommended to create a batch
file (.BAT under Windows) to avoid typing the options with each use.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">One can then add an icon on the
desktop, which launches this command file, and on which one clicks to
update each modification of a file.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In a personal environment one can place
all the options in the file batch.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">In a collective environment, it is not
advised to put the password in the file. It should be asked by the
program at runtime instead.</p>
<h2>Two operational modes</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Two modes of operation are possible,
with additional options:</p>
<ol style="margin-bottom: 0cm">
  <li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Transfer according to the
	period.<br>In this case all the files modified the very same day or
	since a given number of days, are transferred on the server. The
	backup directory becomes optional then.</p>
  </li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Associated transfer and
	backup.<br>The files are compared with the contents of a backup
	directory. Those whose date (at the second near), are more recent
	are copied to the server and also in the backup directory. In the
	backup, original date and time are applied to the copy (for further
	comparison). 
	</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">It is possible also without using
backup, to compare the files with those which are stored on the
server, but the operation is extremely slow.</p>
<h2>Syntax of the command line</h2>
<p>The command has the form:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25cm">solp ftpsync [options] [parameters]
sourcedir [URL] 
</p>
<p>or directly in PHP:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25cm">php ftpsync.php [options] [parameters]
sourcedir URL</p>
<p>The parameters allow to give the login, the password, etc. If a
required parameter misses, the program prompt for it.</p>
<p>The options define the mode of update and what one wants to
display at runtime. When an option misses, the default option is
used.</p>
<p>The URL is the FTP address, in the &ldquo;ftp . scriptol .com&rdquo;
form. If it is omitted, the program asks it.</p>
<p><u>Options and parameters</u></p>
<p><b>- t</b> Test mode, the program
proceeds virtually and displays what it would do. But nothing is
modified neither on the server, nor in the backup directory. By
defect the mode is real.</p>
<p><b>- ndays</b> Last days mode. The
code -n is followed by a number of days: 0 for today, 1 for yesterday
and so on. All that is modified in the <span style="text-decoration: none">given
</span>period, today, yesterday or during the n last days, is
uploaded on the server. 
</p>
<p><b>- bbackup</b> Defines the backup
directory and states consequently that one chooses the backup mode.
The date of files is compared with that of files in this directory,
the more recent files are uploaded on the server. &ldquo;Date&rdquo;
actually means the exact moment in seconds.<br>If this option is
omitted, the program will compare the files with those which are on
the server. The transfer is very slow and could be interrupted by the
server.</p>
<p><b>-ddirectory </b>Defines the
directory on the server, in which one copies the files. Often the
site is in a www directory. It is then necessary to add this option:</p>
<pre><span style="text-decoration: none"><b>-dwww/</b> Define the sub-directory. </span> </pre>
<p>On a multi-domain hosting, it is
necessary to indicate the name of the directory associated with a
domain. The directory is the same one as that which one uses with a
FTP transfer software.<br>
This directory is not part of the URL given to the browser. </p>
<p><b>- llogin </b>Defines the login.
If - l is specified but that nothing follows, the program display an
error message. But if the option is not given, the program will
prompt for the login at runtime.</p>
<p><b>- ppassword </b>Defines the
password. Works like for the login. If you are working in a
collective environment, do not put the password in a command file. It
is better to enter it when the program ask for it.</p>
<p><b>-c</b> For a comparison of
contents rather than on dates. That is done with the backup directory
and is of course slower than the comparison by date, which is the
default option.</p>
<p><b>-a</b> Upload all the files to
restore the site, no comparison is made. If a backup directory is
given, the files will be also copied in this directory.</p>
<p><b>-v </b>Verbose mode. Display more
details about what is done.</p>
<p><b>-q</b> <span style="text-decoration: none">Quiet
Mode. Do not display anything about action of the program.</span></p>
<p><u>Options for link check</u></p>
<p>It is possible (since version 1.3) for each page loaded on the
server, to test the links it contains, in order to avoid broken
links, whether internal or external links. <br>Two options have been
added to activate the checking: <br><b>-u</b> Activation of the test.
<br><b>-wsite </b>Indicate the domain of the site. <br><br>The URL of
the site is necessary for relative internal links, to rebuild an
absolute URL. <br>If the ftp address is also that of the site, the
option-w is superfluous, the ftp URL will be transformed into http.
This is not the case with sites sharing the same host, we must
specify the domain of the site.</p>
<p><u>Option for site map</u></p>
<p>The site map is automatically updated with any page is put online. If the page is already referenced,  only the date will be updated. The frequency and priority are not changed.</p>
<p><b>-m</b> Enable updating the site map. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>PHP FTP Synchronizer is an
extensible program. If you are even a beginner in programming, you
can easily add options in the source.<br>In the event of problem to
use PHP FTP Synchronizer, do not hesitate to post on the forum in the
language of your choice, S<span style="text-decoration: none">criptol.com
